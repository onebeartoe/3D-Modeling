This is better, but there is some stringing still, but good enough.

This version uses the same settings as 01, but rotated to print on the X axis.

It came out okay, but with loose strands.

This had the same slicer (Cura 5.2.1) settings with the following changes

	rotate 90 degrees on the Z axis to print on the Y axis
	change Print Spreed to 50mm/s to 40mm/s 


00
It failed.
